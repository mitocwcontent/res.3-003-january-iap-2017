Mark Vrablic demonstrates how the Unity game engine connects to the Microsoft Kinect. The guided tutorial that students have completed called “roll-a-ball” is a game normally driven by arrow keys on a standard keyboard. In this video, Mark shows how to modify the game to have the controls be dictated by the position of the user’s hands and other body parts in space.
