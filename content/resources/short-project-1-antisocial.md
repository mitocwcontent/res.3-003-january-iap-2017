Student team presentation about their videogame “Antisocial“, a game about street harassment and non-verbal communication designed to educate players about the complexities and variety of undesired socialization. The vision of the game is a player walks down a virtual street while being approached by various unsavory characters; the player must respond with the appropriate gesture to deter the approaching characters and to keep them out of the player “safety zone”. For instance, a player might play as an investor walking to lunch while having to push away people seeking to make unsolicited business proposals.
