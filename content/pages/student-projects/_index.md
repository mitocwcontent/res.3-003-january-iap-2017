Students worked for one week to design and build videogames in the Unity game engine that included full body gesture interactions through the Microsoft Kinect controller. (Image by H. Sharon Lin, MIT OpenCourseWare.)

In this workshop, students deliver two videogames:

[Short Project]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/student-projects/short-project)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Students form teams of two to three and collaborate to develop their first videogame.

[Long Project]({{< baseurl >}}/pages/student-projects/long-project)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

After the demo of their first project, students either choose to stay in the same team or swtich to a different team to further develop the short project into a bigger game; alternatively, they can form a new team of three to four and design a new game.
